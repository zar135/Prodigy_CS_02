# Simple Image Encryption Tool
This project provides a simple image encryption tool that uses pixel manipulation techniques to encrypt and decrypt images. 
The encryption is performed using a basic XOR operation on each pixel with a specified key.

# Features
Encrypt Images: Applies an XOR operation to each pixel with a given key to encrypt the image.
Decrypt Images: Reverses the encryption process to retrieve the original image.
Support for Various Image Formats: Works with common image formats like JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc.
# Requirements
Python 3.x
Pillow (PIL) library
NumPy library
